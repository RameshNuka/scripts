The ELK Stack
The ELK stack is a popular open-source solution used for log and event data collection, storage, analysis, and visualization. It consists of three main components:
		Elasticsearch: This is a powerful distributed search and analytics engine. It's designed to handle large amounts of data and perform real-time searches on it. Elasticsearch is the heart of the ELK stack and is responsible for storing the data.
		Logstash: Logstash is a data processing pipeline that can ingest data from various sources, process it, and send it to Elasticsearch for storage and analysis. It's particularly useful for transforming and enriching data before it's indexed.
		Kibana: Kibana is a web-based visualization tool that allows you to explore the data stored in Elasticsearch. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating dashboards, visualizations, and performing ad-hoc searches.
Beats
Beats are lightweight, single-purpose data shippers that can send data from hundreds or even thousands of machines to either Elasticsearch or Logstash. Beats are easy to deploy, have low resource consumption, and are designed for specific use cases. There are several types of Beats, each tailored for different data sources:
		Filebeat: Filebeat is used for shipping log files. It can be set up to monitor specific log files or locations and send the log data to Elasticsearch or Logstash.
		Metricbeat: Metricbeat collects system-level performance metrics from the operating system and services running on the server. It can be used to monitor CPU usage, memory, network statistics, and more.
		Packetbeat: Packetbeat monitors network traffic by capturing network packets. It can analyze the traffic to extract information about protocols, transaction data, and even detect anomalies.
		Heartbeat: Heartbeat is used for monitoring the availability of services by sending periodic pings and tracking response times.
		Auditbeat: Auditbeat collects security-related events from the audit framework on Linux systems, providing insights into user activity, system changes, and potential security threats.
These are just a few examples of Beats available within the Elastic Beats family.
Use Cases
The ELK stack and Beats are used in various use cases, including:
		Centralized Logging: Collecting and analyzing logs from multiple sources in a centralized location for troubleshooting, monitoring, and compliance.
		Infrastructure and Application Monitoring: Gathering performance metrics from servers, applications, and services to monitor their health and detect performance issues.
		Security Information and Event Management (SIEM): Analyzing security events and logs to detect and respond to security threats and incidents.
		Business Intelligence: Visualizing and analyzing data for making informed business decisions.
		IoT Data Analysis: Collecting and analyzing data from IoT devices.
