I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your support and guidance in my challenges, opportunities, learning and helping me in making my work easier. I have also learnet a lot - from professional skills to personal growth from you.

It is with great respect for you and sadness at the thought of no longer working together that I must say bye for now.

Hope our paths cross again..

Thank you for being a part of my journey here at BT/ Wipro.

Wishing you good luck.
