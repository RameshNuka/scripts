Prerequisites
Windows Servers: Prepare three Windows servers (physical or virtual) to use as nodes in your ELK cluster.

Java: Install Java JDK 8 or later on each node. ELK components are Java-based, and Java is required for them to run.

Elasticsearch: Download and install Elasticsearch on each node.

Download the Windows version of Elasticsearch from the official website.
Extract the downloaded package to a directory of your choice.
Configure Elasticsearch by editing the elasticsearch.yml file. You'll need to set the cluster name, node name, and network settings. Make sure to set the same cluster name on all nodes.
Start Elasticsearch on each node using the provided script.
Logstash: Download and install Logstash on each node.

Download the Windows version of Logstash from the official website.
Extract the downloaded package to a directory of your choice.
Configure Logstash by creating a Logstash configuration file (e.g., logstash.conf) to specify input, filter, and output plugins. Make sure to configure the output plugin to send data to your Elasticsearch cluster.
Start Logstash on each node using the provided script.
Kibana: Download and install Kibana on one of the nodes (this will be your Kibana node).

Download the Windows version of Kibana from the official website.
Extract the downloaded package to a directory of your choice.
Configure Kibana by editing the kibana.yml file. Set the Elasticsearch URL to point to your Elasticsearch cluster.
Start Kibana on the Kibana node using the provided script.
Firewall Rules: Ensure that the necessary firewall rules are set up to allow communication between the nodes on the required ports. Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana have default ports that need to be open for communication.

Cluster Management
With the basic setup complete, you now have a simple ELK cluster with three nodes. Here are some management tasks you'll need to handle:

Scaling: You can add more nodes to your cluster as needed. Just install the required ELK components on the new nodes, configure them to join the existing cluster, and adjust your load balancers if necessary.

Monitoring: Use Kibana to monitor the health and performance of your ELK cluster. Create visualizations and dashboards to keep track of Elasticsearch indices, Logstash pipelines, and system metrics.

Backup and Recovery: Implement a backup strategy for your Elasticsearch data. Elasticsearch provides tools for snapshot and restore operations. Make sure to regularly back up your indices to prevent data loss.

Security: Implement security measures to protect your ELK cluster. This includes setting up authentication and authorization, enabling HTTPS for communication, and configuring role-based access control (RBAC).

Updates: Stay up-to-date with the latest versions of Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana. Periodically check for updates, test them in a non-production environment, and then update your production cluster.
