Phase 2: Development Cluster Upgrade (Week 3)
Upgrade ELK components in this order:
Elasticsearch (Rolling upgrade: Master → Data → Coordinating/Ingest Nodes).
Kibana (Validate dashboards, RBAC, visualizations).
Logstash & Beats (Test pipeline compatibility).
Validate indexing, queries, dashboards, alerting.
Fix any compatibility issues.
Phase 3: Production Cluster 1 (Week 4-6)
Upgrade in a phased approach:
Upgrade 5-7 nodes at a time, starting with master nodes.
Monitor cluster health (_cluster/health, _cat/nodes).
Validate dashboards, queries, integrations (Grafana, SIEM, etc.).
Tune performance settings as needed.
Leave a 1-week stabilization period before moving to the next cluster.
Phase 4: Production Cluster 2 (Week 7-9)
Follow the same upgrade process as Production Cluster 1.
Monitor ingestion rates, cluster performance, and alerting.
Phase 5: Post-Upgrade Optimization (Week 10)
Fine-tune ILM, shard allocation, query performance.
Address any lingering issues.
Conduct post-upgrade training for the team.
Update documentation.

Elasticsearch Version Upgrade Roadmap (8.15 to 9.x)
1. Objective
Upgrade Elasticsearch clusters from version 8.15 to 9.x in a phased approach, ensuring minimal downtime and risk.
2. Upgrade Plan & Timeline
Phase	Task	Start Date	End Date
Planning	Assess compatibility, dependencies, and risks	DD/MM/YYYY	DD/MM/YYYY
Dev Upgrade	Upgrade Dev cluster, test functionality	DD/MM/YYYY	DD/MM/YYYY
Staging Upgrade	Upgrade Staging cluster, validate performance	DD/MM/YYYY	DD/MM/YYYY
Production Upgrade	Perform rolling upgrade in Prod, monitor impact	DD/MM/YYYY	DD/MM/YYYY
Post-Upgrade Validation	Monitor system, optimize performance, and resolve issues	DD/MM/YYYY	DD/MM/YYYY
3. Pre-Upgrade Tasks
•	Backup Data: Snapshot all critical data before the upgrade.
•	Check Compatibility: Verify plugins, security settings, and custom integrations.
•	Upgrade Dependencies: Ensure Kibana, Logstash, and Elastic Agents are compatible.
•	Test in Lower Environments: Conduct a test upgrade in Dev before moving to Prod.
4. Upgrade Execution Steps
1.	Take Snapshots: Create full cluster backups.
2.	Upgrade Dev Cluster: Validate impact, test queries, dashboards.
3.	Staging Upgrade: Performance testing, failover scenarios.
4.	Production Upgrade (Rolling Upgrade if HA is enabled, Full Restart otherwise): 
o	Upgrade Master Nodes → Data Nodes → Ingest Nodes
o	Monitor Cluster Health (_cat/health, _cat/nodes)
5.	Post-Upgrade Validation: Verify logs, metrics, and application functionality.
5. Risks & Mitigations
Risk	Mitigation Strategy
Downtime during upgrade	Use rolling upgrades, blue-green deployment
Plugin incompatibility	Verify plugins before upgrade
Performance degradation	Monitor cluster load, optimize JVM settings
Data loss	Ensure successful backups before upgrade
