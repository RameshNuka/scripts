Dear ${name},

Sometimes, life puts you in situations where you've to let go of things dearer to you in pursuit of something better. Few days ago, I was in a similar situation and I had to make a hard decision - to take up new challenges and start a new phase in my career.

I want to take this opportunity to thank you for your support and guidance in my challenges, opportunities, learning and helping me in making my work easier. I have also learnet a lot - from professional skills to personal growth from you.

It is with great respect for you and sadness at the thought of no longer working together that I must say bye for now.

I’ve also appreciated knowing you on a personal level, and very much hope we can continue this relationship beyond my final day and hope our paths cross again..

Thank you for being a part of my 6 years journey here at TCS.

Wishing you good luck.
