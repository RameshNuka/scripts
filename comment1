You've been there for me through every important milestone — from the very beginning. Right from my interview, through onboarding, and into the thick of the project, you’ve been a constant presence.

I still remember sharing the news with you when my baby came into this world — and now, I'm sharing another big moment: my resignation from the project.

It means a lot that you've been a part of all these defining chapters. Thank you for being someone I could always count on, both professionally and personally.
